LLD (Low-Level Design) rounds in **product-based companies** usually test your **object-oriented design, design patterns, and coding skills**. The interviewer gives you a problem statement (often an existing real-world system) and asks you to design it with **classes, relationships, and extensibility** in mind.

Here‚Äôs a list of the **most commonly and recently asked LLD questions** in product-based companies (Amazon, Microsoft, Uber, Flipkart, Swiggy, Zomato, Ola, etc.):

---

## üîπ 1. Categorized LLD Prep Sheet

### üü¢ **Easy Level** (to warm up with OOP + patterns)

* Vending Machine
* Tic Tac Toe / Snake & Ladder
* Elevator (single lift version)
* Logging Framework
* ATM Machine
* Notification System (basic, only one channel)

üëâ *Follow-ups:* Add more states, retry mechanism, scaling for multiple users.

---

### üü° **Medium Level** (frequently asked, product company favorites)

* Parking Lot (multi-floor, multiple vehicle types)
* Splitwise / Expense Sharing
* Movie Ticket Booking (with seat reservation)
* Library Management System
* Food Ordering (Swiggy/Zomato)
* Meeting Scheduler (Google Calendar Lite)
* Digital Wallet (Paytm/PhonePe wallet)
* Rate Limiter (Token Bucket / Leaky Bucket design)
* Online Shopping Cart (Flipkart/Amazon checkout flow)

üëâ *Follow-ups:* Handle concurrency, scaling to millions, extend to more payment/notification methods.

---

### üî¥ **Hard Level** (deep product-based interviews)

* Ride Hailing Service (Uber/Ola)
* Hotel Management System (OYO, Trivago)
* File Storage System (Dropbox/Google Drive)
* Chess Game with AI
* API Gateway / Service Mesh design
